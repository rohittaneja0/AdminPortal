# AdminPortal
Project
COSC 4351

Due Date: December 6, 2019 23:59:59

Description: 
You have been asked to build an admin portal that will allow your company internal employees to access the portal and perform admin functions on behalf of company clients.

Here are additional details:

(a) Admin portal is accessible only on company network to only company employees that have one of the "ADMIN" roles. 
(b) Access to the links is role based i.e. only authenticated internal employees with "ADMIN" role are able to access the portal and what links you can access once on the portal is determined based on what other roles you have. So, same link will not be visible to other admin who doesn't have appropriate role to access the link.
(c) There are five categories of applications and 5 admin roles for each category. Here are the details:

#	Category	Role			Access								Links
====================================================================================================================================================
1.	Global		ADMIN			All Global links						{Manage User Accounts, Assign Roles, Help Desk}
2.	Finance		FINANCE_ADMIN		All Global links + All Finance Category links			{Finance Reports, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivables, Tax}
3.	Sales		SALES_ADMIN		All Global links + All Sales Category links			{Sales Reports, Sales Leads, Sales Demo}
4.	HR		HR_ADMIN		All Global links + All HR Category links			{New Hire, On-boarding, Benefits, Payroll, Terminations, HR Reports}
5.	Engineering	ENGG_ADMIN		All Global links + All Engineering Category links		{Application Monitoring, Tech Support, App Development, App Admin, Release Management}

(d) The links redirect users to the admin application that is not developed by you. You are only providing links to the portal and redirect users to appropriate application.
